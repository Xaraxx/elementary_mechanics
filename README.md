# Solving :blue_book: Elementary Mechanics Using Python :snake:

This project I'm resolving the exercises from the book :blue_book: [Elementary mechanics using python](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-19596-4) write by Anders Malthe-SÃ¸renssen and edited by Springer Editorial, and in my opinion is an excelent book if you are starting to study computational physics. 

To me is this just a funny activity to solving this exercises, but if this repo is useful for someone there, or you have any question, feel free to leave a message.
